# Udacity: Secret Message
A python program to encode and decode secret messages. 

#Purpose
This program was created as part of a Udacity nanodegree course.  The course itself provided the tools to create a basic cipher program. I then took the program a step further but adding more functionality. The messages are presented via image files rather than through console output.  Additional functionality could possibly provide a solution for both.

I am new to python and have zero experience in real cryptography.  This program is for learning purposes.

#Changelog
coming soon
